Channels
---------

-   Like waitgroups Channel are also synchronization
    primitive
-   While sync.WaitGroup is designed specifically to wait for a  collection of goroutines to finish, channels are more versatile, serving as both a communication mechanism and a, tool to synchronize execution between goroutines. 

-   Follows Go's phil of "Sharing memory by communicating , instead
    of communicating by sharing memory. 

-   channel are typed (int , string etc etc)
-   Created using make function


Unidirectional Channels
-----------------------

-   Unidirectional channels are created using with " <- " operator
-   When " <- " is in front it represents/indicates read-only channel
     <-chan string
-   When " <- " is after it indicates/represents write only channel
     chan<- string

     (Now see how to declare them in Concept.go)

-	Unidirectional channels are used as function parameters.
	You wont see Unidirectional channel very often , they are 
	mainly used in function parameters


Reading and Writing
-----------------------
-   The <- is also used to read from and write to channels
-   To read you place the <- operator in the left and to write,
    you place <- operator on the right
-   Will get Error if reading from a write-only channel
    and writing a readonly channel
(Now go and see the concept.go //Reading and Writing section) 


Closing a Channel
------------------
-   Channels are closed using the global function called close
-   Reading from a closed channel is not an error 
-   Reading from a closed channel returns two values , 1st is the
    value it self and second is a bool indicating 
-   syntax : close(channel_name)

    (Go back to Concept.go and see how closing works and doesnt give any error)


For Range Clause in Channels
----------------------------

-   The for range clause can be used to read from channel
-   Ranging over channels returns a single value
-   In go Closing a channel is also used to indicate
    something has occurred

(Not written code for this , as of now)


NIL Channels
------------
-   Reading from NIL Channels gives Deadlock
-   Closing NIL CHannels give Panic


Channel OwnerShip
-----------------

-   Writer should be responsible for writing and closing the 
    channel 
-   Reader should be responsible for reading and handling the
    closing of channel


Buffered Channels
-----------------
