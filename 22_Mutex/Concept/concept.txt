Mutex
-----

-   Mutexes are the other half of Go concurrency.
-    If channels are about communication, mutexes are about protection.


Why Do We Need a Mutex?
------------------------
The problem: data race
Code :
                count := 0

                for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
                    go func() {
                        count++
                    }()
                }
❌ Multiple goroutines modify the same variable
❌ Final result is unpredictable
❌ This is a data race




What Is a Mutex (Plain English)
----------------
    A mutex is a lock.
    -Only one goroutine can hold the lock
    -Others wait
    -Protects shared data


Creating a Mutex
------------------
Code :    var mu sync.Mutex



Locking and Unlocking (The Core)
------------------------------
Code :
            mu.Lock()
            count++
            mu.Unlock()

Rule #1
Every Lock MUST have an Unlock



defer mu.Unlock() (BEST PRACTICE)
---------------------------------
Code :
            mu.Lock()
            defer mu.Unlock()
Why?
-    Prevents forgetting Unlock
-    Safe even on panic or early return


Use mutex in this format 
    Lock 
    (some modification)
    Unlock

Dont write the complete logic between Lock and Unlock
because then concurrency wont be there. So just wrap
it around the part which is getting modified , since 
mutex is used for solving the problem of Data Race
condition
