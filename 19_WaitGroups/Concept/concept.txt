sync.WaitGroups in Go lang

*   sync.WaitGroups is a synchronization primitive in go 
    that is used to wait for collection of go routines to 
    complete their execution

*   It allows to coordinate the execution of multiple go
    go routines and ensure that they all complete before 
    continuing with the rest of the program     

*   For eg , there is a party and arrangements (go routine)
    are to be made. WG acts as a checklist which checks 
    whether all the arrangements are done before starting
    of party.
